# posters-with-pagedown

These are the files I need to create a presentation, Posters
using pagedown, which I first presented at the Kansas City 
R Users group on Saturday, May 18, 2019.

You can view the final Powerpoint just fine without any 
version of RStudio, but You need R Studio verison 1.2 or 
higher to recreate or modify the Powerpoint presentation. 
You also needs the Pagedown library.

Some of the images may be copyrighted. Please check with
the original source.

This application does not need any special files beyond the
ones listed above.
